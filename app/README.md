This frontend isn't needed for the token bonding curve (see https://github.com/rally-dfs/dfs-ts for a general purpose frontend that includes the token bonding curve), but since this is forked from anchor-token-swap, https://github.com/rally-dfs/anchor-token-swap/blob/main/app/README.md may be useful if you need something from here.
